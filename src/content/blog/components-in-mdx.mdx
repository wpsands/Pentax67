One of the biggest advantages of MDX over plain Markdown is the ability to embed components directly in your content.

## Callout Variants

You can create different types of callouts for different purposes:

<Callout type="info">
  **Info:** Use this to highlight useful information for your readers.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Warning:** Use this to warn readers about potential pitfalls.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Tip:** Share helpful tips and best practices with your audience.
</Callout>

## A Simple Counter

Here's a server-rendered counter component showing how you can embed any Astro component:

<Counter initial={42} />

## Mixing Markdown and Components

The real power is in **mixing** regular Markdown with components seamlessly. You can:

1. Write a paragraph in Markdown
2. Drop in a component
3. Continue with more Markdown

It all renders together as a unified page. No special configuration beyond the MDX integration is required.

```astro
---
// Example: Using an Astro component
import MyWidget from '../components/MyWidget.astro';
---
<MyWidget title="Hello" />
```

That's the beauty of MDX in Astro!
