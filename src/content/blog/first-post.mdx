Welcome to our first MDX blog post! MDX lets you use JSX components directly in your Markdown content.

## Why MDX?

MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of components. Here's what you can do:

- Write content in familiar Markdown syntax
- Import and use Astro (or framework) components
- Add interactive elements to your pages

<Callout type="info">
  This is a custom Astro component rendered inside MDX. You can build reusable
  content blocks this way!
</Callout>

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```js
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Astro + MDX.`;
}
```
