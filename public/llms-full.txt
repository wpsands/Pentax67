## Camera Versions

There are four distinct versions of the Pentax 67. All share the same bayonet lens mount and most accessories.

### Asahi Pentax 6x7 (1969–1976)
- The original. Fully mechanical shutter (1s to 1/1000s + Bulb).
- No mirror lockup (MLU). This is a significant limitation — the massive mirror creates vibration that can soften images on a tripod at 1/8s to 1/30s.
- CdS metering prism available (battery powers meter only, not shutter).
- Price: $300–600 body only.
- Verdict: Avoid unless significantly cheaper than MLU version.

### Pentax 6x7 MLU (1976–1989)
- Added mirror lockup via sliding switch on right side of body.
- Otherwise identical to original 6x7. Same shutter, same lens mount.
- MLU is essential for sharp tripod results with this camera.
- Best value in the system — functionally identical to the later Pentax 67.
- Price: $350–700 body only.

### Pentax 67 (1989–1998)
- Cosmetic rebrand from "6X7" to "67".
- Key improvement: SPD metering cells replace CdS (faster response, better low-light accuracy, no memory effect).
- Same mechanical shutter and lens compatibility.
- Price: $400–800 body only.
- Verdict: Sweet spot of reliability and value.

### Pentax 67II (1998–2009)
- Significant redesign: built-in right-hand grip, top LCD panel.
- AE prism with aperture priority auto exposure.
- Selectable metering modes (center-weighted, spot).
- Electronic shutter (battery required to fire — unlike earlier mechanical models).
- Double exposure capability.
- Price: $1,500–2,500 body only.
- Verdict: Best camera in the system, but 3–4x the price of a 67.

### Which to Buy
For most shooters: Pentax 6x7 MLU or Pentax 67. Functionally identical, well under $1,000. The 67II is better but not 3x better — put the savings toward lenses and film.

## Lens System

The Pentax 67 lens lineup is the largest in medium format, with 20+ focal lengths. All use the same bayonet mount across all body versions.

### 105mm f/2.4 (55mm equivalent)
The defining lens of the system. Razor sharp wide open, beautiful bokeh, distinctive orange-red flare orb in backlight. Three versions exist (latest has best coatings). Minimum focus: 39 inches. Price: $400–700. Buy this first.

### 75mm f/4.5 (38mm equivalent)
Wide-normal. Extremely sharp stopped down. Often $100–200 — the best value in the entire system. Great for environmental portraits, street, landscapes. Buy this second. (A rare 75mm f/2.8 AL with aspherical element also exists but is far more expensive.)

### 55mm f/4 (28mm equivalent)
True wide angle. Slower at f/4 but sharp across the frame stopped down. Some barrel distortion at edges.

### 45mm f/4 (23mm equivalent)
Ultra-wide. Heavy lens, sharp center, edges soften until f/8+. Specialized.

### 90mm f/2.8 (46mm equivalent)
Closer minimum focus (25 inches) than the 105mm. Strong alternative for portrait work. LS (leaf shutter) version available for flash sync.

### 135mm f/4 Macro (70mm equivalent)
True macro capability. Excellent for product photography, still life, tight portraits.

### 165mm f/2.8 (85mm equivalent)
Classic portrait focal length. Paper-thin DOF at f/2.8 on 6x7. Gorgeous but heavy. A separate 165mm f/4 LS (leaf shutter) version exists for studio flash sync. The 105mm does 90% of this at half the price.

### 200mm f/4 (100mm equivalent)
Telephoto. Solid performer, not essential for most kits.

### Lens Buying Priority
1. 105mm f/2.4 (non-negotiable)
2. 75mm f/4.5 ($100–200, incredible value)
3. 165mm f/2.8 or 90mm f/2.8 for portrait work (165mm f/4 LS for studio flash)
4. 55mm f/4 for wide angle
5. Everything else as needed

## Viewfinders

### Waist-Level Finder
Lightest option. No metering (use handheld meter). Reversed left-right image. Great for tripod work. $50–150.

### TTL Metering Prism
Center-weighted TTL metering. Eye-level viewing. CdS version (older, slower) vs SPD version (67-era, better). Meters drift over time. $150–400.

### AE Prism (67II only)
Aperture priority auto exposure. Selectable metering modes. Most accurate metering in the system.

## Film Recommendations

The Pentax 67 shoots 120 film (10 frames per roll). At $1.50–3.00+ per frame with processing, choose deliberately.

### Color Negative
- Kodak Portra 400: The default. Gorgeous skin tones, great latitude. Overexpose 1 stop.
- Kodak Portra 160: Finer grain. Bright daylight and tripod work.
- Kodak Ektar 100: Saturated, punchy. Landscapes. Less forgiving.
- Kodak Gold 200: Budget option. Warmer tones.

### Black and White
- Ilford HP5 Plus 400: Versatile workhorse. Pushes well.
- Ilford Delta 100: Fine grain, maximum detail.
- Kodak Tri-X 400: Classic grain structure.
- Ilford FP4 Plus 125: Extremely fine grain.

### Slide Film
- Fuji Provia 100F: Fine grain, accurate. Demands precise exposure.
- Fuji Velvia 50: Hyper-saturated. Landscapes only. Unforgiving.
- Kodak Ektachrome E100: Slightly warmer alternative.

## Shooting Tips

### Handheld
Minimum safe shutter speed: 1/125s. Brace elbows, support lens with left hand, exhale and squeeze. Use MLU even handheld.

### Tripod
Always use MLU + cable release. Lock mirror, wait 1–2 seconds, fire. Sturdy tripod required (15+ lb rating).

### Metering
TTL prism: center-weighted, meter the important area, recompose. Handheld: Sekonic L-308X or phone apps. Sunny 16 as sanity check.

## Common Issues

- Mirror stuck up: Gently press down. Needs CLA if recurring.
- Shutter not firing: Check film advance, MLU switch, battery (67II only).
- Light leaks: Replace foam light seals ($15–25 DIY kit).
- Inaccurate meter: Use handheld meter, get prism CLA.
- Mirror slap vibration: Use MLU at 1/8s–1/30s. Not a defect.

## Repairing the Pentax 67

A Pentax 67 is a mechanical camera built to last decades, but every mechanical system needs maintenance.

### What a Full CLA Includes
A qualified technician disassembles the camera, cleans degraded lubricants from the shutter mechanism and film transport, removes sticky stoppers from the mirror and shutter assemblies, replaces light seals and mirror bumper, applies fresh lubrication, and calibrates meter and shutter speeds to factory specifications. Budget $250–400 for a full CLA.

## Pentax 67 vs Other Medium Format Systems

### vs Mamiya RB67/RZ67
Both are 6x7 SLR systems. The Mamiya has a rotating back (portrait/landscape without turning the camera) and bellows focusing. The Pentax handles more like a 35mm SLR and has a larger lens selection. Mamiya is more of a studio camera; Pentax is more versatile for field use.

### vs Hasselblad 500C/M
Hasselblad shoots 6x6 (square). Smaller negative than 6x7. Modular system with interchangeable backs, lenses, and viewfinders. The Hasselblad is lighter and more compact. The Pentax 67 gives a larger negative and handles more intuitively for 35mm shooters.

### vs Mamiya 7
The Mamiya 7 is a rangefinder, not an SLR. Much lighter and more portable. No mirror slap. But no SLR viewing, limited lens selection (6 lenses from 43mm to 210mm), and no interchangeable viewfinders. If weight matters, the Mamiya 7 wins. If versatility and lens selection matter, the Pentax 67 wins.

### vs Fuji GW690
The "Texas Leica." A fixed-lens 6x9 rangefinder. Shoots an even larger negative but has no interchangeable lenses and no metering. Extremely simple and reliable. A different kind of camera for a different workflow.

## FAQ

Q: Is the Pentax 67 worth it in 2026?
A: Yes. For under $1,000 (body + lens), you get 6x7 negatives that rival medium format digital backs costing $10,000+. The lens lineup is the best in medium format.

Q: Can you shoot the Pentax 67 handheld?
A: Yes, at 1/125s or faster. The mass absorbs some vibration. Use MLU even handheld.

Q: What battery does the Pentax 67 use?
A: The 6x7 and 67 use a 6V 4SR44 battery for the meter only. The shutter is mechanical. The 67II uses two 3V CR123A lithium batteries (6V total) and requires a battery to fire.

Q: What is the difference between the Pentax 6x7 and 67?
A: Primarily the metering prism (CdS vs SPD cells). Same shutter, lens mount, and accessories.

Q: How many shots per roll?
A: 10 frames on 120 film.

Q: What is CLA?
A: Clean, Lubricate, Adjust. Professional camera service. Budget $250–400 for any used purchase.

Q: What is the best Pentax 67 lens?
A: The 105mm f/2.4. Buy it first. It is the reason most people buy this camera.

Q: How much does a Pentax 67 weigh?
A: About 2.5kg (5.5 lbs) with prism and lens attached.

Q: Is the Pentax 67 good for portraits?
A: It is one of the best portrait cameras ever made. The 6x7 negative with the 105mm f/2.4 produces images with a depth and dimensionality that digital cameras struggle to match.

Q: Pentax 67 vs 67II — which should I buy?
A: The 67II is the better camera (auto exposure, better grip, spot metering) but costs 3–4x more. For most shooters, the 67 or 6x7 MLU at $400–800 is the better value.

Q: Where can I get a Pentax 67 repaired?
A: For Pentax 6x7 and 67 bodies, Eric Hendrickson at pentaxs.com is the most trusted specialist — a retired Pentax tech with decades of experience and access to original parts. Free estimates, six-month warranty. For the 67II (which Eric does not service), try Advance Camera Repair in Portland, OR. Budget $250–400 for a CLA.

Q: What film should I use in the Pentax 67?
A: Start with Kodak Portra 400 (color) or Ilford HP5 Plus 400 (B&W). Both are forgiving, versatile, and look beautiful on 6x7 negatives.
